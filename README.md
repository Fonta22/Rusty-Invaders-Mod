## Getting Started

To get started with Rusty Invaders, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Txreq/rusty-invaders.git
 cd rusty-invaders
 ```
3. **Build and Run:**

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Controls

The controls are a little bit off, I didn't find a way to check for a `HOLD` button state, so... I made the player to constantly move and be able to change its direction. Use `ARROW KEYS` to change direction, `SPACE` to shoot and `R` to restart if you died.
